----Video Storytelling Strategies-----
A good video marketing strategy can help your business connect with your ideal audience and build a firm foundation within your market. At the height of the digital age, nearly everyone is consumed by video, whether for the purpose of business or pleasure. As humans, we are attracted to storytelling by nature because we enjoy hearing about what others are doing and dreaming of the things that we could do ourselves. Over the last century, we have become conditioned to give our attention to video and it has become widely popular in the world of marketing as a result.

So what makes a good video marketing strategy? There are a number of ways to connect with your customers and create a link that resonates with their desires and goals. Here, we’ll focus on three big actions you can take that can have a positive effect on your overall marketing strategy.

---Personalize Connections With Segmented Audiences-----
The most entrancing videos are those that provide viewers with a one-to-one level of personalization. However, it goes without saying that it isn’t feasible to create thousands of videos by researching individual prospects. That’s why many successful marketers will segment their audiences and then tailor a smaller number of video storytelling strategies to appeal to different demographics including geographic location, prospect age, or gender, or psychographic elements such as behavior or motivation. This way, you can create a more personal connection with prospective clients and customers because your message focuses on the attributes that they value.
